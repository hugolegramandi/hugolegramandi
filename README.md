## About me

I am a tech enthusiast with a passion for design and building things currently working in education, engineering and robotics.

I love to travel, learn and share, living life with minimalism and stoicism.

My goal in life is to help people realize their dreams and projects around the world, contribute to the evolution of our society, and enjoy life, have freedom, speed on the fast lane and enjoy the walk. Always keep in mind that happiness is not a destination, it is a journey. It's not tomorrow, it's now. It's not a dependency, it's a decision. It's what you are, not what you have.

Professionally I just want to build something that can provide direction for all my goals without taking away from my peace.

I am 24 years old, I have been working for 6 years as an Educational Robotics teacher, where I became the coach of the PINGOSTORMS team, which got national prominence and an award for best innovative solution for cities of the future, among other achievements.

Graduated in Civil Engineering, having developed my TCC in Modular Construction and taking a post-graduate course in Off-site Construction at the ITIE - Institute of Building Industrialization Technologies. Currently working as a consultant for project development and direction aiming at a disruption in Civil Construction.

Having experience with programming and ease of learning new software, I am currently learning Full Stack Development with HTML, CSS and Javascript through Resilia EducaÃ§Ã£o.

Something interesting to share with me? You can offer me coffee, no sugar please.
